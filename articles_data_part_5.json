The main tie speaks to her compliance with her spouse, the subsequent knot connotes her obligation to the in-laws, and the third knot speaks to her regard for God. Typically, a mangalsutra is a slender gold wire chain with black beads. The gold wire and black mani should destroy the bad vibrations. Before the bad energy reaches the bride and her family, the dark dabs absorb it. Essentially, the mangalsutra is a defensive sheath around a lady’s body and shields the marriage from any evil eye.\nThe holy deities Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati are symbolically represented in the mangalsutra. The black gold beads represent Lord Shiva, and the gold portion represents Parvati. Gold is a representation of success and happiness. As a result, it is said that a woman who wears a mangalsutra gives happiness and wealth to the family. Scriptures claim that a lot of good and divine energy is attracted to the Mangalsutra.

This offers the mother the strength to look after the needs of the entire family and each individual.\n\nOffers Protection from Heart Diseases:\nA quick shield for the heart is said to be provided by a mangalsutra when it hits the Anahat chakra. Thus, it is said that women who are wearing mangalsutras are shielded against cardiovascular problems like uncontrolled blood pressure, heart attacks, and cardiac arrest.\nKeeps Negative Energy Away:\nThe mangalsutra's black beads are said to protect the woman wearing it from evil spirits and harmful energy. In addition to providing peace, it also lowers tension, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

        "title": "Oxidized Jewelry To Flaunt Your Ethnic Side",
        "description": "Oxidized Jewelry Guide: Types, How to Style Them, and More\nEvery woman's fascination has long been jewelry. Any ensemble you wear has to include a few specific accessories to make the whole thing pop. Gold and silver jewelry used to be the height of fashion. Jewelry made of gold was highly desired. The fascination with gold, however, faded as time went on. Gold jewelry has somewhat diminished in importance as a daily wearable item as a result of price increases, costly maintenance, and constantly shifting fashion trends. Gold jewelry is viewed less as something we should use to adorn ourselves and more as a piece of property.\nOxidized jewelry has recently been flying off the shelves in stores. From fashion icons to famous people, and from working women to students and college students.\n\nOrigin of Oxidized Jewelry\nIndia, a country with astounding diversity, has long had a wide selection of jewelry according to its area. Over the years, the Bhils, Santhals, and Gonds of the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and the Chotanagpur Plateau have produced oxidized jewelry. Copper and bronze were the preferred metals at Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro, where metal history may be found. Later, the Indo-Gangetic plains' Vedic culture helped usher in the era of iron and gold. The metals were initially utilized for practical purposes before being transformed into a range of decorations like necklaces, bracelets, amulets, earrings, anklets, etc. Silver darkens due to oxidation, a natural process of metals degrading due to oxygen, and eventually became the main element of oxidized jewelry. Around 1100 AD, it was done manually using sulfur, and afterward, gold plating was added.\nType of Oxidized Jewelry You Must Own\nOxidized Necklaces:\nOxidized necklaces offer you the ideal vintage look. You may add a gorgeous oxidized necklace to your plain blouse and long skirt to make it appear more classy. With its fashionable appearance, you will feel lovely and at ease. These come in a variety of styles, including high neck chokers, lengthy necklaces, pendant-adorned chains, and even plain chains. The intricate lockets and pendants are set with additional colored semi-precious stones. Some are even painted to draw attention to the intricate details of the design. These little design elements make them even more attractive and adaptable to be worn with both Western and Indian-style apparel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Earrings:\nA pair of earrings can be added to complete your classic appearance. If you add a pair of oxidized jhumkas to your plain kurta, you'll appreciate how youthful this ensemble looks. They frequently appear in floral patterns as well as peacock and elephant themes. The spectacular earrings are rather large and frequently include eye-catching, detailed workmanship. They are frequently used in conjunction with textured stones in the colors magenta and turquoise blue as well as colored wooden beads. When paired with apparel that has silver thread accents or is in cool colors like blue, grey, or black, they draw attention to your outfit! German silver earrings that have been oxidized are also quite popular and, with proper care, endure longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Bangles & Bracelet:\nBangles are popular among girls. Bangles that have been oxidized have long been popular. The wonderful thing about oxidized jewelry is that it complements both classic and contemporary attire. Some of the most popular metal shade variants in oxidized fashion jewelry are dull gold, pale silver, black metal silver, and German silver. Women typically enjoy stacking a few colored bangles in between thin, oxidized bangles. You may also show off the Indo-Western mood that they give off by wearing your jeans with a white kurta, oxidized fashion jewelry, and vibrant juttis. Bangles are being created in a variety of forms and designs as part of jewelry design courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Maang Tikka:\nGirls today like playing around with their appearances. The wearing of headgear is becoming more popular. Some of the most popular headgear designs in India include maang tikka and matha Patti. They go nicely with ethnic clothing like lehengas and sarees as well as Indo-Western clothing. A headpiece and a stack of bangles may be used with your dress to create a very chic and current wedding or evening party appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Rings:\nWhen you want to stand out in a crowd, an oxidized ring is the ideal choice. To get a daring style for a nighttime party, pair your jewelry with your attire. Realize your aspirations of creating memorable and eye-catching earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and more. These rings come in a variety of sizes and styles. Additionally, they are set in a gold and silver mix, making them suitable for clothing with both silver and gold embellishments. It might be difficult to combine gold and silver without coming across as garish or overdressed. But these rings both make this a popular match and simplify our lives!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Nose Ring:\nSilver oxidized nose rings are an absolute must if you have a nose piercing. The oxidized nose jewelry has intriguing forms and patterns. More modern patterns, such as those with themes of the Sun, fruits, symbols, divine signs, flowers, and leaves, have recently become quite popular. There are also clip-on oxidized nose rings available for people with unpierced noses. Simply put on them, add some eyeliner, and you'll be ready to invent your fashion moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidized Anklets:\nBecause women frequently wear anklets, ethnic style, boho style, and indie style are all popular. Anklets made of oxidized metal that come in a variety of widths and patterns are the ideal method to make a fashion statement at events, work, or school. Oxidized anklets, whether they have a single thread or several strings decorated with small ghungroos, are the epitome of love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Can You Style Your Oxidized Jewelry:\nHowever, we are aware that styling oxidized jewelry is more complicated than it appears. The general perception is that oxidized jewelry is always big and bold. There may be a lot of ideas going through your head. Can you wear it with contemporary clothing? Can you enter the workplace wearing rusted neck pieces or earrings? All of your inquiries and more are addressed below.\nPut a Bollywood spin on it\nOxidized jewelry is something for you if you enjoy going on a dramatic route.

You may take it a step further and add oxidized ghungroos that are thin and fragile. Even if you are getting ready for a dinner date, you may up your style game by simply accessorizing your straightforward red dress with silver rusted jewelry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice jewelry made of oxidized metal\nThe nicest thing about oxidized jewelry is how inexpensive and attractive it is. Every woman may quickly identify an item that is exclusively her own and further personalize it by embracing it to create the desired style. Keep in mind that oxidized jewelry doesn't have to be garish. Simple jewelry options for your business clothing include little stud earrings, neck pieces, bracelets, and finger rings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a fusion spin to it\nJewelry that has been oxidized allows for experimentation. Oxidized jewelry may enable you to explore and design it as you want, whether you want to work with a variety of colors or prefer monochromatic. Even if all you do is wear jeans and an oversized t-shirt, oxidized jewelry may help twist the outfit and improve the overall appearance.\nAdditionally, you may add rusted jewelry to dresses to give them a more fusion appearance. Cotton dresses go nicely with this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating rusted jewelry with ethnic clothing\nYou can match your ethnic clothing with gold or diamond jewelry for a wedding or any other significant event. It's time to embrace the oxidized appearance. There are several oxidized accessories, ranging from statement neck pieces to jhumkas or chandelier earrings, that look great with every ensemble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurtas and Kurtis may be worn for school or any occasion as long as you accessorize with silver oxidized jewelry to make a statement. Cotton sarees and oxidized jewelry go together like peaches and cream. There is nothing else that compares to how amazing they look together. Additionally, oxidized jewelry goes nicely with shararas and lehengas.\nActivate your inner bohemian\nThis fashion trend is for you if you adore the entire bohemian aesthetic.

Consuming multigrain daily is important. In the daily rush, we neglect to emphasize eating fulfilling meals. We need diets that support our immunity on the daily basis. In the Sanjeevini multigrain drink, Ayurveda-recommended ingredients are combined with rapid health treatment. It is a potent quick mix produced from nine different varieties of traditionally grown Indian superfoods farmed locally, including millets, lentils, cereals, and nuts. This healthy beverage with multiple grains can substitute for a full meal. \n\nIngredients in Sanjeevini Multigrain Drink:\n\nIts ingredients make it the best multigrain drink available in the market currently. They are: \nJowar, Green gram, Wheat, Groundnut, Bajra, Ragi, Cardamom, Fried Gram, Rice, Cloves, Dried ginger, Soya, and Country sugar. There are no added preservatives or artificial colors. \nHealth Benefits of Sanjeevini Multigrain Drink:\nConsuming multigrain drinks regularly holds several health benefits. Let’s look at some of its key benefits:\n\nContains Fibre- An average adult should consume 20 to 30 grams of fiber daily. There are 3 types of fibers, soluble, insoluble, and resistant starch. Sanjeevini multigrain drink contains all three kinds of fibers which are beneficial for your health. Fiber takes a long time to digest; therefore, it makes your stomach feel fuller for longer. \nResistant starch- carbohydrates, if consumed in good form, is beneficial for you. One such type of carbohydrate is resistant starch. It is a kind of fiber that digests slowly, giving you energy for a longer period without increasing your fat. \nImproves digestion- The fiber in the multigrain drink keeps the bowel movement regular. Multigrain along with fibers contains lactic acid which increases the production of good bacteria, hence improving digestion. It also boosts nutrient absorption. \nHealth Improvement- Achieving good health is not an overnight thing. You need to make a few lifestyle changes regularly and stick with those to improve your overall health. Multigrain drinks by Isha life will help you in leading a healthy life by not putting much effort. You just need to have this simple drink daily. \nHow to Use Sanjeevini Multigrain Drink: \nStep 1: To make a smooth paste, combine 50 ml (1/3 cup) of water with 2 tablespoons (20 gms) of Sanjeevini multigrain powder.\nStep 2: Boil a cup of water \nStep 3: Stir the paste into the boiling water, then continue to cook the mixture for 5 minutes, or until it looks like porridge.\nStep 4: To taste, add jaggery or palm sugar.
