If you are confused about styling your ethnic wear, don\u2019t worry we have got you covered. Here are some of the styling tips for your traditional day wear:\n\nGo for bright-colored kurta sets or Anarkali if you want a festive look. You can style them with a matching heavy dupatta. Choose a contrasting color dupatta to create a more edgy look. If you are wearing a blue kurta set, team it up with a hot pink dupatta. Trust me I would look super good.\nIf you are looking for a more sober look, choose a pastel shade of Anarkali (brownie points if it's white). Pair this up with a bright-colored dupatta and matching big chandbali earrings. To accessorise, pair it with a mojari and not a sandal this time. Mojaris look extraordinarily trendy and suit ethnic wear the most.\nGlam it up with makeup! Good makeup can lift the look instantly. You can go for a vibrant eyeshadow or dark-colored lipstick to accentuate the look. Just make sure to highlight just one part of your face. If you are doing heavy eye makeup, go lighter on the lips and vice versa.\nCarry a nice bag to elevate the look. Go for a mirror work bag or an embroidered potli bag to carry as an accessory.\n\nDressing sensibly simply means being conscious of how you look, knowing what clothes suit you, and learning how to present oneself as appealing. It also shows your character and way of life. Always choose ethnic wear that suits your personality and style. BIBA ethnic collection has something for each type of fashion lover.

        "description": "Distacart Cyber Monday 2024: Home to amazing deals found nowhere else!\nWho doesn\u2019t love to buy things at great discounts? Whether it\u2019s buying a home d\u00e9cor item or something for personal use, it's good to keep an eye on great deals and discounts to not miss any opportunities to make a saving.\u00a0\nBut there is one day of the year that may be more notable for consumers than the others. Of course, this is Cyber Monday. This has grown into a sizable online shopping event in recent years, during which retailers reduce prices and give steep discounts on a variety of goods. It gives customers a great chance to stock up on discounted goods in the lead-up to Christmas.\nLet's examine Cyber Monday deals in more detail and see why it is so significant.\nWhat is Cyber Monday?\nThe first Monday following the American Thanksgiving holiday is referred to as \"Cyber Monday\" in marketing. It is a 24-hour online shopping occasion that was initially developed by companies to entice customers to purchase online and is now frequently viewed as a continuation of the Black Friday deals.\nIn 2005, the first Cyber Monday was introduced to increase internet retail (which at that time was still relatively niche). Since that time, online shopping has expanded quickly, and Cyber Monday has followed suit. In 2005, Cyber Monday sales revenues were only $484 million, but by 2019, they had reached a record $9.4 billion.\nThis demonstrates how quickly Cyber Monday became one of the most significant shopping days of the year, and it appears that it will continue to grow in the coming years.\nWhen will Cyber Monday fall in 2024?\nThree days after Thanksgiving, on December 2, 2024, this Cyber Monday deals will take place.\u00a0\u00a0A majority of the retailers run these deals over the weekend, so tune in on November 30 to snag some early discounts.\nWhat is the Difference Between Cyber Monday and Black Friday?\nThe phrase \"Black Friday\" has its roots in the 1950s, whereas \"Cyber Monday\" has much more contemporary roots. The phrase was created in 2005 to refer to the Monday following Black Friday when consumers continued their online shopping after returning to work. The year's largest online shopping day, Cyber Monday, presents a tremendous chance for eCommerce merchants to increase sales.\nNumerous astute and shrewd retailers take advantage of the \"Black Friday sales season\" (which often begins around Tuesday) to ascertain which specials and promotions are effective and then use those revelations to maximize their Cyber Monday sales. Businesses can increase revenues and satisfy their clients by swapping out unpopular offers for those that are in high demand. Although Black Friday promotions have historically been concentrated in-store, the idea of Black Friday as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season is evolving as more consumers prefer to look for deals online.\nThe week between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is now frequently referred to as \"Cyber weekend,\" and as the sale goes on, the discounts get deeper and steeper. Retailers should take advantage of the chance to get rid of excess inventory and collect vital information in advance of the Christmas sale.\nWhat to Buy During Cyber Monday?\nDistacart comes with a Cyber Monday deal. Shop for products you long waited for this Cyber Monday. Remember that many stores begin their Cyber Monday bargains on the Saturday or Sunday following Thanksgiving. Nowadays, \"Cyber Weekend\" deals are just as common as \"Cyber Monday\" deals. These are the products available\u00a0on our website that you can shop for this season.\u00a0\n\nPersonal Care & Wellness Gifts:\nDistacart Cyber Monday deals are the best time to buy wellness gifts for you and your loved ones.

        "description": "Give Your Look a New Turn with L'oreal Paris Hair Color Range:\nDoes your hair have a color? If the answer is yes, it might be time to try out a fun new color and enhance your entire appearance. If the answer is no, it's time for you to join the hair coloring craze and give your friends a brand-new style as a surprise. When it comes to coloring your hair, L'oreal Paris Hair Color for Professionals is the safest choice for you. This brand doesn\u2019t intend to bleach your hair with peroxide; rather, they aim to enrich or change your common locks with high-quality hair color.\n\nWhy Should You Color Your Hair?\nWith changing times, trends change too. Coloring your hair gives you a new look. You can experiment with the colors and go for the permanent color that suits you. Here are some of the reasons for coloring your hair.\nIt's beneficial for natural or already-dyed hair\nAlthough it has been said that coloring your hair harms your natural hair, we no longer hold that belief. The composition of hair color components has substantially improved thanks to new technology and formulae. A new color can also make hair look fuller. Loreal hair color products earn bonus points for eliminating bothersome fly aways and frizz without the need for an iron or anti-frizz spray.\nDue to yearly trends in hair color\nIt's a terrific method to choose a hair color you adore while staying on trend to recreate the styles you see on the runway. Many people tend to lighten their hair during the summer and darken it during the winter as an echo to the changes in fashion attire with light colors for spring and summer and deeper hues throughout the fall and winter.\nIt covers grey\nSimply put, women of any generation can appreciate quality hair dye to hide their grey hair. If you\u2019re looking to get rid of your grey hairs, you can easily color them at home by using the Loreal hair color kit.\nBecause it adds texture\nIf your hair is thin and missing volume, or even lacking shine and a glossy finish\u2014a new hair dye can update your underwhelming strands. Coloring your hair can emphasize texture and add luster to bring back your hair\u2019s shine due to overexposure. Achieve extra volume with the thickening agents found in hair dye products, but always get the full look that comes with a change in hair color.\nBecause you got a haircut\nWhen you\u2019re at the salon getting a new haircut, add color to the mix for a complete hair overhaul. If you\u2019re going to ask for a daring new cut, expand your beauty comfort zone and maximize the look with a bold hair dye.\nBecause you need to match your skin tone\nSometimes, your natural hair color does not flatter your inherent skin tone, causing a discrepancy between two essential elements of a beauty look. Your hair color should complement your skin tone, so that\u2019s always a great reason to change your color. It can also highlight your cheekbones and distract from any skin conditions you are looking to conceal.\nBecause you need a recharge\nEven if you use a professional, permanent hair dye, your color will fade and become less and less vivacious the longer it lives on your scalp.

For the first-timer, at-home hair color can be daunting. In addition to reading and following the directions, here are five tips to help perfect the process:\nStrand Test\u2013 There are a few reasons why strand testing is key to a successful at-home color. First, it determines if you have an adverse reaction to the dye and its ingredients. And secondly, it is a great way to see if the hair color shade you chose is the correct one before committing to an all-over semi-permanent color.\u00a0\nProtect Your Hairline\u2013 It\u2019s hair color. It stains. And yes, that means if it comes in contact with your skin, it will stain that as well. That\u2019s why applying a thin layer of Vaseline around your hairline provides a barrier of sorts to protect your skin as you get as close as possible to the roots that border your face.\u00a0\nPrep the Set Up\u2013 Make sure you have everything you need for the dyeing process so you don\u2019t have to stop in between to grab a towel or gloves. Every time you stop can lead to your hair color staying on for too long, which can cause irritation or dryness.\nSkip the Bottle\u2013 If you want your hair to look professionally colored, then you need to act like one and use a bowl and brush. Skipping the bottle is key when it comes to controlling. A brush allows you to get closer to the roots, allowing for more time to process regrowth.\nGet Dirty\u2013 Try and go for at least three days without washing your newly colored strands. Waiting allows the cuticle to close, lock in color, and restore hair\u2019s natural pH. When you do shampoo and condition, be sure to use color-safe products to preserve and prolong your desired shade.\nThe Bottom Line\nTo sum up, you must buy hair color by keeping in mind a lot of factors. Make sure the color is of good quality and you apply it correctly to avoid any damage to the hair. L'oreal Paris Hair Color helps you in achieving exactly the color you want with maintaining hair health.

We, through this guide, would like to address some common skin problems and suggest a simple and easy way to choose the suitable product for your concern based on your skin type. However, remember every skin is beautiful and unique in its own way, make sure these products are to protect your skin and improve its health.\n\nThe most common skin problems are acne, aging, wrinkles, blemishes, dark circles, large pores, dry skin, blackheads, melasma, dark spots, and pigmentation.

So let's now tell you what you all need to know.\n\n\nOily Skin:\u00a0If you think you have oily skin try purchasing products that are having the best ingredients for oily skin, such as hyaluronic acid, green tea, retinol, clay, niacinamide, glycolic acid, and vitamin C. You can definitely find the best results if you can choose any of these ingredients-based Oil control skincare products, in a form of cream, gel, moisturizer, face wash, face scrubs, face cream, or in any desired form. On top of everything, skincare rules for oily skin are to avoid fried foods, dairy products (in excess), salt, and savories as these kinds of foods might worsen the oily skin.\n\nDry Skin:\u00a0If you feel white flaky peeling skin or extremely dry skin that seems lifeless, all you have to do is strictly follow a skincare routine with products that fight against your dead and dry skin. Dry skin people are more likely to look aged than those people having oily and combination skin types. As there is no hydration, the skin under the eyes or creases appears in early times and looks older than your age. They lose hydration and elasticity around the eyes because the skin around the eyes is way too sensitive to any parts of the face. Do make sure your skincare products are based on any of these ingredients such as ceramides, glycerin, vitamin E, shea butter, jojoba oil, argan oil, and gel or oil-infused products.\n\nAlong with the right face wash and face scrub, it is important to stick to a few products based on your skin problem, some of the concern-resolving products are mentioned below, take a glance and start your skin treatment accordingly.\nSunscreen:\nNo matter how much you take care of your skin, if you cannot protect yourself with a layer of sunscreen, everything goes in vain.

        "description": "Winter Skincare Routine- The Best Products For Winter:\nWinter is the time of the year when your skin needs more care and attention than any other. It is important to keep your skin hydrated and protected from the harsh elements of nature during this season. The cold winds and low temperatures can dry out our skin and make it more susceptible to breakouts. To combat this, here are some tips for keeping your skin healthy during the colder months:\n\n\n Take a shower in lukewarm water\n\nTaking a hot shower in the winter is one of the most common causes of dry, itchy skin. I can't blame you - we've all been there. But it's important to remember that while we may be tempted to crank up the heat in our showers during these cold months, extreme hot water can actually cause damage and irritation on your skin.\u00a0\n\n Keep your skin hydrated\n\nKeeping your skin hydrated is essential for healthy skin. Moisturizers are a great way to lock in moisture and keep your face feeling smooth and supple, but there are several other ways you can keep your skin supple as well.\nDrink lots of water! Keeping yourself hydrated will help prevent dryness, flakiness, and even wrinkles. Drinking water is also great for helping flush toxins out of the body so that your face looks less puffy or swollen from puffiness or inflammation from irritants like pollution\u00a0\n\n Protect your skin from the sun and wind\n\nYou should be using sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day, even if you're just going out for a walk. This is especially true in winter, when there's less daylight and more UV rays reflecting off snow and ice. Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before going outside, and make sure to apply it liberally. If possible, apply moisturizer after you've applied sunscreen so that they work together to hydrate your skin; this will help keep it soft so it doesn't crack over time due to dryness caused by lack of moisture retention during colder months (dryness makes our skin age faster).\n\n Eat healthy foods\n\nWhen you're eating for the health of your skin, there are a few things to consider. You should make sure that the foods you eat are rich in vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C and vitamin E. These nutrients will help improve the skin's appearance and make it more elastic. They also provide protection from UV rays when applied topically.\nA well-balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables (such as apples, carrots and leafy greens) will give you all the vitamins your body needs to stay healthy during winter months when sunlight exposure is limited.\n\n Stay active\n\nThe fifth and final tip to keeping your skin healthy is to stay active.\nExercise helps to keep your skin healthy by reducing stress, improving sleep, and improving self-esteem. Exercise also helps to maintain a healthy weight which can reduce signs of aging like wrinkles and dark spots on the skin.\nImportance of Skincare Products in Winter:\nTo keep your skin healthy and glowing, there are some winter skincare products that you must have in your beauty kit. These products will help maintain the elasticity of your skin, as well as its suppleness. They will also help prevent dry patches from forming on your face. Winter skincare products contain ingredients that help to hydrate your skin, soothe irritation and improve skin tone.\nHere are some of the best winter skincare products that you should add to your beauty routine:\nMoisturizing Cream: The most important step in winter skincare is to use a good moisturizer cream after washing your face. You can use a day cream or night cream depending on your preference. But, it is always better to use a night cream as it has more time to get absorbed into your skin than a day cream does. You must use a face moisturizer at least twice a day to keep your skin hydrated. The best time to apply moisturizer is right after washing your face at night before going to bed and right after washing it in the morning before applying makeup or going out into the sun. If you don't have time to apply moisturizer every day, then you can use it once a week, preferably on weekends when you stay indoors most of the time.\n\nLip Care Products: Lips are another area that may become dry during cold weather. Lip balm and lip scrub can help keep them healthy and soft during these months. If you have chapped lips due to cold weather, try using a lip balm with SPF in it so it will protect against sun damage at the same time as treating dryness.\n\nSunscreen: Sunscreen is an essential part of any summer kit. It can be used in winter as well, to protect your skin from harsh sun rays. Most people use sunscreen during the summer months, but it can also be used during winter days. The main reason for using sunscreen in winter is to prevent sunburns and other skin damage that can occur when exposed to direct sunlight.\nThere are many uses\u00a0for sunscreen\u00a0on winter days and here are some of them:\n\nPreventing sunburns\n\n\nPreventing premature aging\n\n\nProtecting your skin from long-term damage caused by repeated exposure to the sun\n\n\nHelping to maintain healthy coloring in your skin\n\n\nBody Cream: Body cream is a product used to moisturize and soften the skin. It can be used on winter days due to\u00a0changes in climate and temperature. It helps in keeping the skin hydrated and soft. The benefits of using body cream\u00a0on winter days:\n\nIt keeps your skin soft by preventing dryness, chapping, and cracking: Body Lotions contain natural ingredients that work as humectants that keep your skin hydrated. They also help in repairing damaged cells and prevent inflammation of the skin.\nIt keeps your face smooth: Body creams are full of essential oils that keep your face smooth by reducing wrinkles and aging spots on your face. These creams also help you achieve a radiant look by reducing dark circles under your eyes or around your mouth area.\n\n\nFace serum: Face serums are a great way of adding moisture and nutrients to your skin deeply. It helps keep your face hydrated for a long time and also promotes cell turnover to reduce acne and scars.\u00a0The serum\u00a0is used to moisturize the skin, reduce wrinkles and acne scars, and improve the texture of the skin.\n\nFace Mist: Face mists are one of my favorite products in the summer season, they are\u00a0lightweight and they do not make your face look oily or greasy which is very important during\u00a0winter when you have dry skin. They also help keep makeup intact for longer hours without any creases or patches on your face!\n\nFace Mask: Face masks/ Sheet Masks are very beneficial for our skin during\u00a0winter because they moisturize it deeply and keep it hydrated for long hours after application. They also help us with pimples and acne problems caused by dryness of the skin during winter. Face masks can be used once or twice weekly depending on your preference but never forget to apply sunscreen after every face mask application to protect yourself from harmful sun rays!\n\nFoot Scrub:\u00a0Foot scrub is beneficial in winter. It helps to get rid of dead skin. It also removes the dirt and dust from your feet. You can use it to exfoliate your skin and prevent it from getting dry. It is also an effective remedy for cracked heels and rough skin on your feet. The scrubbing action of the ingredients found in the foot scrubs\u00a0helps in smoothing your rough skin.\n\nCrack Cream:\nCracked skin is a common problem during the winter season. Skin becomes dry and cracked due to the low humidity in the atmosphere. Cracked skin can be very painful, especially when you walk or rub it against something. Here are some uses of crack cream in winter:\n\n\nCrack cream is made with Shea butter, which is known for its ability to lock in moisture and keep your skin hydrated when it\u2019s cold outside. When used regularly, the cream can help prevent dryness and chapped lips during the winter months.\nCrack creams also contain aloe vera extract, which helps prevent infection from cuts and scrapes on your hands or feet caused by winter weather conditions like snow, ice, or salt on sidewalks and roads.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all, it's important to take note of your skin's needs during the winter. You can't just use the same products you did in the summer; if you do, your skin will be dry and flaky by February. And if you don't want to go through that again this year, follow our advice\u2014it'll help keep your face looking smooth and young!\u00a0\nTo keep your skin healthy and glowing, there are some winter skincare products that you must have in your beauty kit. These products will help maintain the elasticity of your skin, as well as its suppleness. They will also help prevent dry patches from forming on your face.

With all the requisites and guidance, you can achieve it too, but first, you have to make sure you start a good hair care routine by following the below steps without fail, those are minimalist and bear minimum things to reduce hair concerns and to enhance hair health.\nSimple and Effective Hair Care Routine:\nA simple and quick hair care routine looks like this - Apply Hair Oil or Serum gently massage, leave it an hour or two, Cleanse with shampoo, use conditioner for the ends, wash thoroughly, dry your hair completely, detangle from edges to roots, moisture your hair with hydrating serums and leave it on without washing again, if you are using hydrating masks, wash it off within 15 minutes or as per the directions mentioned, let it dry.\u00a0\nHair Oiling:\nLike serums Hair oils are also the best part of the routine, they can deeply penetrate and provide nutritional content to the scalp which helps in reducing hair concerns, nourishing the hair, and revealing lustrous hair.\u00a0\n\nFrequent Shampooing:\nYes, you read it right, all you need to do is to keep your hair and scalp clean. Make sure you buy shampoo online that\u00a0suits your hair type and\u00a0resolves your hair woes. Hair Conditioner is a must to keep hair free from dryness and fizziness. Dry hair can be washed at least 2 or 3 times a week, while oily hair can indulge in hair wash more than 3 times. The right shampoo and conditioner would do justice to your hair and scalp by balancing the pH.\n\nHydrate your Hair:\nBuy the best Hair Serum online to hydrate the scalp and the hair, no routine is better than hydrating the hair with a serum. It protects the\u00a0scalp's health, tames dandruff, fizziness, infections, and dryness, and promotes hair growth.\n\nHair Masks:\nInvest in the best Hair Masks online, truly indulging your hair with Hair Masks once in a while can result in strengthening, deep cleansings, conditioning, rejuvenation, and hydration.\n\nReplace Plastic Comb with Wooden Comb:\nThe way you brush your hair matters, and so does the comb. While detangling your hair start from the edges of the hair. Use a Wooden comb to avoid damage and dandruff to the hair. Reverse strokes from the scalp to the ends should be brushed slowly with no harsh pressure, also make sure you use a separate comb, don't share it with anyone to prevent dandruff and dirt transfer.\n\nNo Tight-Pull Ponytails:\nYou will never know how much damage a tight ponytail can do to your hair; it breaks the hair from the scalp and the re-growth will take much longer than you expect it to. Make sure you style it with a loose ponytail or a loose hair updo.\n\n\nPrevent Sun Exposure:\nHair Sunscreens are nowhere underrated; they are as important as skin sunscreens. In the long run, hair can be subjected to brutal damage with harmful UVB rays, hence it is essential to apply hair sunscreens while stepping out, and it is necessary to wear a scarf, or cap to avoid sun rays to a great extent.\n\nEat Right:\nNo matter how much you try\u00a0to protect the hair from the outside, if you are not eating a balanced diet, then all your efforts go in vain. Make sure you take a lot of proteins, vitamins, biotin, iron, zinc, and calcium. If you follow a\u00a0nutritionist-suggested diet for your hair, it can do wonders for you from the inside.\n\nStay Away from Hair Styling Tools:\nHealthy hair looks absolutely beautiful without any styling, a gliding silky hair has to be preferred to artificially heated straightening strands. Styling tools usage can show visible damage to the hair within no time, go for hair accessories online\u00a0that are useful for styling without any heat or current requirements.\n\nTrim\u00a0Your Hair:\nFor healthy and\u00a0clean-looking hair, do make sure you chop and trim the hair to keep it in shape and to avoid brittle and split ends.\u00a0\n\n\nIn fine, if you wonder where to get the best hair care products online, Distacart would be your best choice.
