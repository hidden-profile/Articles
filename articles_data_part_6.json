If you are confused about styling your ethnic wear, don’t worry we have got you covered. Here are some of the styling tips for your traditional day wear:\n\nGo for bright-colored kurta sets or Anarkali if you want a festive look. You can style them with a matching heavy dupatta. Choose a contrasting color dupatta to create a more edgy look. If you are wearing a blue kurta set, team it up with a hot pink dupatta. Trust me I would look super good.\nIf you are looking for a more sober look, choose a pastel shade of Anarkali (brownie points if it's white). Pair this up with a bright-colored dupatta and matching big chandbali earrings. To accessorise, pair it with a mojari and not a sandal this time. Mojaris look extraordinarily trendy and suit ethnic wear the most.\nGlam it up with makeup! Good makeup can lift the look instantly. You can go for a vibrant eyeshadow or dark-colored lipstick to accentuate the look. Just make sure to highlight just one part of your face. If you are doing heavy eye makeup, go lighter on the lips and vice versa.\nCarry a nice bag to elevate the look. Go for a mirror work bag or an embroidered potli bag to carry as an accessory.\n\nDressing sensibly simply means being conscious of how you look, knowing what clothes suit you, and learning how to present oneself as appealing. It also shows your character and way of life. Always choose ethnic wear that suits your personality and style. BIBA ethnic collection has something for each type of fashion lover.

Whether it’s buying a home décor item or something for personal use, it's good to keep an eye on great deals and discounts to not miss any opportunities to make a saving. \nBut there is one day of the year that may be more notable for consumers than the others. Of course, this is Cyber Monday. This has grown into a sizable online shopping event in recent years, during which retailers reduce prices and give steep discounts on a variety of goods. It gives customers a great chance to stock up on discounted goods in the lead-up to Christmas.\nLet's examine Cyber Monday deals in more detail and see why it is so significant.\nWhat is Cyber Monday?\nThe first Monday following the American Thanksgiving holiday is referred to as \"Cyber Monday\" in marketing. It is a 24-hour online shopping occasion that was initially developed by companies to entice customers to purchase online and is now frequently viewed as a continuation of the Black Friday deals.\nIn 2005, the first Cyber Monday was introduced to increase internet retail (which at that time was still relatively niche). Since that time, online shopping has expanded quickly, and Cyber Monday has followed suit. In 2005, Cyber Monday sales revenues were only $484 million, but by 2019, they had reached a record $9.4 billion.\nThis demonstrates how quickly Cyber Monday became one of the most significant shopping days of the year, and it appears that it will continue to grow in the coming years.\nWhen will Cyber Monday fall in 2024?\nThree days after Thanksgiving, on December 2, 2024, this Cyber Monday deals will take place.  A majority of the retailers run these deals over the weekend, so tune in on November 30 to snag some early discounts.\nWhat is the Difference Between Cyber Monday and Black Friday?\nThe phrase \"Black Friday\" has its roots in the 1950s, whereas \"Cyber Monday\" has much more contemporary roots. The phrase was created in 2005 to refer to the Monday following Black Friday when consumers continued their online shopping after returning to work. The year's largest online shopping day, Cyber Monday, presents a tremendous chance for eCommerce merchants to increase sales.\nNumerous astute and shrewd retailers take advantage of the \"Black Friday sales season\" (which often begins around Tuesday) to ascertain which specials and promotions are effective and then use those revelations to maximize their Cyber Monday sales. Businesses can increase revenues and satisfy their clients by swapping out unpopular offers for those that are in high demand. Although Black Friday promotions have historically been concentrated in-store, the idea of Black Friday as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season is evolving as more consumers prefer to look for deals online.\nThe week between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is now frequently referred to as \"Cyber weekend,\" and as the sale goes on, the discounts get deeper and steeper. Retailers should take advantage of the chance to get rid of excess inventory and collect vital information in advance of the Christmas sale.\nWhat to Buy During Cyber Monday?\nDistacart.com comes with a Cyber Monday deal.

        "description": "Give Your Look a New Turn with L'oreal Paris Hair Color Range:\nDoes your hair have a color? If the answer is yes, it might be time to try out a fun new color and enhance your entire appearance. If the answer is no, it's time for you to join the hair coloring craze and give your friends a brand-new style as a surprise. When it comes to coloring your hair, L'oreal Paris Hair Color for Professionals is the safest choice for you. This brand doesn’t intend to bleach your hair with peroxide; rather, they aim to enrich or change your common locks with high-quality hair color.\n\nWhy Should You Color Your Hair?\nWith changing times, trends change too. Coloring your hair gives you a new look. You can experiment with the colors and go for the permanent color that suits you. Here are some of the reasons for coloring your hair.\nIt's beneficial for natural or already-dyed hair\nAlthough it has been said that coloring your hair harms your natural hair, we no longer hold that belief. The composition of hair color components has substantially improved thanks to new technology and formulae. A new color can also make hair look fuller. Loreal hair color products earn bonus points for eliminating bothersome fly aways and frizz without the need for an iron or anti-frizz spray.\nDue to yearly trends in hair color\nIt's a terrific method to choose a hair color you adore while staying on trend to recreate the styles you see on the runway. Many people tend to lighten their hair during the summer and darken it during the winter as an echo to the changes in fashion attire with light colors for spring and summer and deeper hues throughout the fall and winter.\nIt covers grey\nSimply put, women of any generation can appreciate quality hair dye to hide their grey hair. If you’re looking to get rid of your grey hairs, you can easily color them at home by using the Loreal hair color kit.\nBecause it adds texture\nIf your hair is thin and missing volume, or even lacking shine and a glossy finish—a new hair dye can update your underwhelming strands. Coloring your hair can emphasize texture and add luster to bring back your hair’s shine due to overexposure. Achieve extra volume with the thickening agents found in hair dye products, but always get the full look that comes with a change in hair color.\nBecause you got a haircut\nWhen you’re at the salon getting a new haircut, add color to the mix for a complete hair overhaul. If you’re going to ask for a daring new cut, expand your beauty comfort zone and maximize the look with a bold hair dye.\nBecause you need to match your skin tone\nSometimes, your natural hair color does not flatter your inherent skin tone, causing a discrepancy between two essential elements of a beauty look. Your hair color should complement your skin tone, so that’s always a great reason to change your color. It can also highlight your cheekbones and distract from any skin conditions you are looking to conceal.\nBecause you need a recharge\nEven if you use a professional, permanent hair dye, your color will fade and become less and less vivacious the longer it lives on your scalp. Over time if your hair becomes dull, and the color loses its tone and vibrancy, you may want to refresh your hair with a temporary color. These temporary hair color products only deposit color to the outside of your hair shaft, so the cuticle of the hair is not compromised.\nBest Loreal Paris Hair Color Range Available on Distacart.com\nL'oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color - 3 Dark Brown\nThis shade of Loreal hair color has a dark tone. It suits almost every skin tone and gives your hair a luster.\n\n// <![CDATA[\n(function () {\n  var scriptURL = 'https://sdks.shopifycdn.com/buy-button/latest/buy-button-storefront.min.js';\n  if (window.ShopifyBuy) {\n    if (window.ShopifyBuy.UI) {\n      ShopifyBuyInit();\n    } else {\n      loadScript();\n    }\n  } else {\n    loadScript();\n  }\n  function loadScript() {\n    var script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.async = true;\n    script.src = scriptURL;\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(script);\n    script.onload = ShopifyBuyInit;\n  }\n  function ShopifyBuyInit() {\n    var client = ShopifyBuy.buildClient({\n      domain: 'browntaped.myshopify.com',\n      storefrontAccessToken: 'cde43d300325f7b29eeeee759a8679c1',\n    });\n    ShopifyBuy.UI.onReady(client).then(function (ui) {\n      ui.createComponent('product', {\n        id: '6557430710431',\n        node: document.getElementById('product-component-1668430765176'),\n        moneyFormat: '%24%7B%7Bamount%7D%7D',\n        options: {\n  \"product\": {\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"calc(25% - 20px)\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"20px\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"50px\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"text\": {\n      \"button\": \"Add to cart\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"productSet\": {\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"products\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"margin-left\": \"-20px\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"modalProduct\": {\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"img\": false,\n      \"imgWithCarousel\": true,\n      \"button\": false,\n      \"buttonWithQuantity\": true\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"0px\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"0px\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"text\": {\n      \"button\": \"Add to cart\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"option\": {},\n  \"cart\": {\n    \"text\": {\n      \"total\": \"Subtotal\",\n      \"button\": \"Checkout\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"toggle\": {}\n},\n      });\n    });\n  }\n})();\n// ]]>\n L'Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color - 6.13 Golden Brown\nThis one is one of the most in-demand colors of all time.

For the first-timer, at-home hair color can be daunting. In addition to reading and following the directions, here are five tips to help perfect the process:\nStrand Test– There are a few reasons why strand testing is key to a successful at-home color. First, it determines if you have an adverse reaction to the dye and its ingredients. And secondly, it is a great way to see if the hair color shade you chose is the correct one before committing to an all-over semi-permanent color. \nProtect Your Hairline– It’s hair color. It stains. And yes, that means if it comes in contact with your skin, it will stain that as well. That’s why applying a thin layer of Vaseline around your hairline provides a barrier of sorts to protect your skin as you get as close as possible to the roots that border your face. \nPrep the Set Up– Make sure you have everything you need for the dyeing process so you don’t have to stop in between to grab a towel or gloves. Every time you stop can lead to your hair color staying on for too long, which can cause irritation or dryness.\nSkip the Bottle– If you want your hair to look professionally colored, then you need to act like one and use a bowl and brush. Skipping the bottle is key when it comes to controlling. A brush allows you to get closer to the roots, allowing for more time to process regrowth.\nGet Dirty– Try and go for at least three days without washing your newly colored strands. Waiting allows the cuticle to close, lock in color, and restore hair’s natural pH. When you do shampoo and condition, be sure to use color-safe products to preserve and prolong your desired shade.\nThe Bottom Line\nTo sum up, you must buy hair color by keeping in mind a lot of factors. Make sure the color is of good quality and you apply it correctly to avoid any damage to the hair.
